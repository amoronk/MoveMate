# Movemate Clone

## Overview
This project replicates the screens and animations from the [Movemate Shipments Mobile App](https://dribbble.com/shots/21617837-Movemate-Shipments-Mobile-App) using **Jetpack Compose**. The goal was to closely match the design and animations for the **Home**, **Search**, **Calculate**, and **Shipment** screens.

    - The top bar and tabs animate into view.
    - Shipment items animate from the bottom.

### 2. **Search Screen**
- Contains a search bar where users can filter shipments or history.
- **Animations**:
    - Search bar and search results animate from the bottom up.

### 3. **Calculate Screen**
- Provides fields for calculating shipping costs based on sender/receiver location, weight, and category.
- **Animations**:
    - Text fields and buttons animate from the bottom up.
    - The categories section slides in from the right.

### 4. **Shipment Screen**

- **Animations**:
    - The top bar and tabs animate in smoothly.
    - Shipment items animate from the bottom as you switch tabs.

## Resources Used
1. **Color Picker**: [RedKetchup Color Picker](https://redketchup.io/color-picker) was used to extract colors from the design.
2. **Icons**: Icons were sourced from [SVGRepo](https://www.svgrepo.com/).

## Libraries Used
- **Jetpack Compose**: The entire UI is built using Jetpack Compose.
